see [installing helm](https://www.eksworkshop.com/beginner/060_helm/helm_intro/install/index.html) for instructions.

### Install Helm

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/helm/master/scripts/get > get_helm.sh

chmod +x get_helm.sh

./get_helm.sh
```

AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild both need [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) service roles to create a Docker image build pipeline.

create an IAM role and add an inline policy that we will use in the CodeBuild stage to interact with the EKS cluster via kubectl.

*Create the bucket and roles:*
```shell
./prereqs2.sh
```
