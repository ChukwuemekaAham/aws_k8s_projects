### GITHUB SETUP

2 GitHub repositories were created. One used for a sample application that will trigger a Docker image build and another used to hold Kubernetes manifests that Weave Flux deploys into the cluster. Note this is a pull based method compared to other continuous deployment tools that push to Kubernetes.

Create the sample application repository by clicking [here](https://github.com/new).
 
Create personal access token at the [New personal access page](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) in GitHub


The access token can be stored securely and reused. so this step is only required during the first run or when you need to generate new keys.

Once Weave Flux is provisioned we need to revisit GitHub one more time to enable Weave to control repositories.
