### CREATE IMAGE WITH CODEPIPELINE

create the AWS CodePipeline using AWS CloudFormation. This pipeline will be used to build a Docker image from the GitHub source repo (eks-example) but this does not deploy the image. Weave Flux will.

Each EKS deployment/service should have its own CodePipeline and be located in an isolated source repository.

Open CodePipeline in the Management Console https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/pipelines. You will see a CodePipeline that starts with image-codepipeline. Click this link to view the details.


The image build will fail initial when there is no code in the repository until an application is added to the GitHub repo (eks-example). Clone the repo substituting your GitHub user name.

commit changes to your repo to start the image build pipeline.

```bash
git add .
git commit -am "Initial commit"
git push 
```

See status along with links to the change and build details in the [CodePipeline console] (https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/pipelines), go to the details page for the specific CodePipeline.

Click on the “details” link in the build/deploy stage, to see the output from the CodeBuild process.

To verify the image is built, go to the [Amazon ECR console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories) and look for your eks-example image repository.
